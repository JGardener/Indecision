Webpack notes: 

- Definitions usually leave a lot to be desired.
- A modular bundle for modern Javascript apps. - this doesn't really help much in terms of defining Webpack


- It allows us to organise our JS. 
Run the app through Webpack, and it spits out ONE JS file with everything in it. 

Rather than adding script tags forever-more into the public/index.html
We can use Webpack instead! 

Webpack breaks up your JS files, turns them into "islands" which can communicate
with each other via the ES6 "import" and "export" syntax. 

This means we can break out all of our React components into individual files, 
rather than having them all bundled together in one "app.js" file. 

app.js will simply import all the components needed and render them to the screen. Easy.
